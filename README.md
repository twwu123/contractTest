# cardano-contract-tester

Minimal app to test cardano contracts, work in progress.

start development environment

```
npm run start
```

For production, you may have to set public path to `/dist/` in webpack config then

```
npm run build
```

This builds the `/dist` folder that can be served on your server.

If you want run production locally, you might want to use the Live Server extension in VSCode to simulate a server environment.
